## Installing

After cloning this project, install its dependencies using `npm i`.

## Testing

For testing we're using selenium, so for running it locally (`npm test`) it's necessary to follow [theese instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver) for your favorite browser.

The preference is having e2e tests so they can be reproduced in multiple browsers through CI (to be configured).
